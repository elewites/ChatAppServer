# ChatAppServer

This is the server side architecture for a React Chat application. 

Check out the client application that consumes this REST API here [ChatAppClient](https://github.com/elewites/ChatAppClient.git).

This server is built with the following technologies: 
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose ODM
- Socket.io Server API

The server is deployed with Heroku.

# Purpose

1. I wanted to create a REST API for a client side chat application. 

2. I wanted more exposure to the design process involved in creating a full stack application. 
- The project gave me valuable experience with backend-frontend architecture and how these two components communicate to each other.  

2. I also wanted to explore using non relational databases, MongoDB in this case and the object data modeling library Mongoose. 

## Installation

The server is deployed to heroku but you can always clone and run it in your local machine.
